Automation and Process Improvements
* Enabled Automatic Certificate Creator Jobs: Successfully worked on automating certificate creation jobs for both qzdocs and qzmatch. This included:
    * Raising and securing the necessary access requests for the Venafi portal.
    * Setting up UAT and development environments for Venafi to ensure the job works as expected.
    * Modifying existing scripts to seamlessly integrate with our applications.
2. Sprint Support and Issue Resolution
* Actively provided support for the sprint, addressing and resolving the following issues:
    1. Added validation to the "Due Date LS" field in the task validation form within qz.
    2. Assisted in resolving other sprint-related tasks and blockers.
3. Bug Fixes and Enhancements
* Source/Broker Code Fix: Resolved issues in the source/broker script by identifying and adding the missing setup.
* Termination of Child/Intermediary Legs: Developed a robust solution for suppressing child legs based on multiple criteria, including:
    * Identifying parent trades based on the admin ID.
    * Analyzing the system entry timestamps of trades.
    * Verifying back-office IDs. Leveraged these criteria to ensure accurate suppression of child legs under defined conditions.
4. Administrative Updates
* JIRA for Signature Changes: Replaced the authorized signatory on BANA STPed confirmations from Jyothi Dixit to Hardik Shah.
* Service ID Password Updates: Proactively updated passwords for expiring service IDs and documented the process for future reference.

5. Testing and Collaboration
* Assisted Linton with testing for the ASIC and MAS UTI release to ensure compliance and smooth rollout.
