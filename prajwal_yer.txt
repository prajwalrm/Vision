### Year-End Review  

**Overview**  
I joined the team at the end of December last year and started contributing actively from the first week of January. Over the past year, I have had the opportunity to work on several challenging initiatives and projects under the Opex program, which have greatly enhanced my technical skills and professional growth. I am honored to have received a **Gold Award** for my work in Opex and a **great review from the team** for delivering high-quality contributions with **bug-free code and zero production issues**. Below are the key contributions I made this year:
